71. What is the difference between Microsoft Entra role-based access control (RBAC) and Azure RBAC?
Select only one answer.
a. Microsoft Entra roles control access to resources such as users, groups, and applications. Azure roles control access to resources, such as virtual machines.
b. Microsoft Entra roles control access to resources, such as virtual machines. Azure roles control access to resources, such as users, groups, and applications.
c. Users with Microsoft Entra roles can make purchases and manage subscriptions. Users with Azure roles have access to all the administrative features in Microsoft Entra.
d. Users with Microsoft Entra roles have access to all the administrative features in Microsoft Entra. Users with Azure roles can make purchases and manage subscriptions.

Answer: a. Microsoft Entra roles control access to resources such as users, groups, and applications. Azure roles control access to resources, such as virtual machines.
Microsoft Entra built-in and custom roles are a form of RBAC in that Microsoft Entra roles control access to Microsoft Entra resources. This is referred as Microsoft Entra RBAC. In the same way that Microsoft Entra roles can control access to Microsoft Entra resources, so too can Azure roles control access to Azure resources. This is referred to as Azure RBAC. Although the concept of RBAC applies to both Microsoft Entra RBAC and Azure RBAC, what they control is different.

c. The AllowAzureLoadBalancerInBound rule is processed first. The AllowVNetInBound rule is processed second. The last rule that will be processed in the NSG is the DenyAllInBound rule.
d. The DenyAllInBound rule is processed first. The AllowVNetInBound rule is processed second. The last rule that will be processed in the NSG is the AllowVNetInBound rule.

Answer: a. The AllowVNetInBound rule is processed first. The AllowAzureLoadBalancerInBound rule is processed second. The last rule that will be processed in the NSG, is the DenyAllInBound rule.
The lowest priority value always has the priority.
